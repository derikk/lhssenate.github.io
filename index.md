title: LHS Student-Faculty Senate
---

Welcome to the Lexington High School Student-Faculty Senate!
The Senate meets after school on Wednesdays in the Library Media Center.

We implement school-wide policies on a number of issues, from things as mundane
as placing extra benches around the school to changes as significant as eliminating
the community service requirement for open campus, allowing students to eat
in the Quad, or determining what information will be printed on transcripts.

All meetings are open to the public! If you want to change something about 
the school, we would love to hear and discuss your ideas.
